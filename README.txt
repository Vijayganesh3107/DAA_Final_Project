1.	Go to the following website https://daaproject1001861777.netlify.app/
2.	Then if the user wants to sort the data, then the user needs to click the Sort button and it would navigate the user to the Soring section
3.	The user must enter the unsorted array in the textarea given and the each number should be separated by a space.This can be done by two methods:
	a.	User can copy the data from the test_data.txt and check the performance
	b.	The user can enter their own space separated data and check the results 
4.	Then the user can choose the sorting algorithm that they want to be performed on the unsorted data from the dropdown list provided
5.	Once the sorting algorithm is selected now the user can sort the unsorted data by clicking the “Sort” button and the sorted data would be displayed below in the textarea.
6.	Along with the sorted data the time taken for the execution in seconds is also displayed in the textbox given.
